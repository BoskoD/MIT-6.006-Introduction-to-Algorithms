Whether it's finding mountain peaks, peak performance days/points in your daily performance(workouts, running, amount of stuff done)

### What is a Peak
Peak is the point/value that is higher than its surroundings. Therefore we can assume that in [1, 6, 1], the 6 is the peak.

- Our definition is going to be exactly this, however we are not looking for the one ultimate peak, but all the peaks we can find. 
Anything that is higher than its neighbors will be a peak for us.
- That way we will often find multiple values, as long as they are peaks. In [4,9,2,7,6,3], 9 and 7 are the peaks.
